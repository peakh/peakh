## 👋 Hi, I am Noah

I develop stuff. Mostly Discord bots.

This README is a draft and may be continued to be worked on soon.

I work with JavaScript, and I am currently learning bits of TypeScript.

I sometimes use HTML and CSS (but we all know those aren't as important since they aren't *programming languages*).
